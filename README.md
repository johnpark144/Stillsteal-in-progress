# Stillsteal_Ecommerce_project--React_Django

- Creater : Yeonghwan Park (John Park)
- Main Tools : React(frontend), Django(backend, restframework)
- Sub Tools : Html, CSS(Tailwind CSS), MySql
- Explantion : This is Ecommerce site that I create for practice,
It's not technically clone, but I refer to some ecommerce sites
only to think which function would be nice to implement.
the reason why I named this site "Stillsteal" is
because when we saw some nice for the price, we say "that's steal!",
so in order to stress those are cheap always, I named "stillsteal"
